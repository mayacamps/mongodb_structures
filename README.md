# mongodb_structures
For each database there are 2 files:
1. PNG file of database structure diagram
2. .js script necessary to create the collections

Use _MONGOSH to create the databases:
1. Run "use database_name" with the desired database name. This will create the database if it doesn't exist.
2. Copy and paste the script of the .js file and run it. This will create all the necessary collections.
3. If you cannot see the newly created database, click on the "refresh databases" button.
